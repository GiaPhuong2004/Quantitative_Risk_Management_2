## 📌 Overview

This project builds and compares multiple **credit default prediction models** to support the development of a **credit scoring system**.  
The objective is to identify individuals likely to default on their loans using statistical and machine learning methods.

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle – *Default of Credit Card Clients*  
- **Original Size**: 30,000 credit card client records from a financial institution in Taiwan  
- **Time Period**: April to September 2005  
- **Sample Used**: `UCI_Credit_Card.csv` — randomly selected 10,000 observations for efficient processing and analysis  
- **Data Contents**:
  - Customer ID  
  - Demographics  
  - Credit limit  
  - Monthly bill balances  
  - Monthly payment amounts  
  - Repayment history (over 6 months)  
  - Default status in the following month  

> Each observation is treated independently. Although the dataset contains monthly variables over a 6-month period, it does not constitute a continuous time series per customer. Therefore, time series modeling was not applied.  
>  
> The models were trained and evaluated using a training-test split to ensure objectivity in performance assessment. While the results have not been validated on Vietnamese credit data, this research provides a foundation for future model development and adaptation once local datasets become available.
